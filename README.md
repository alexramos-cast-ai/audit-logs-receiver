Website: https://www.cast.ai

Custom OpenTelemetry Collector Receiver for collecting CAST AI Audit Logs

## Testing


CAST AI Collector's distribution is generated using [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder) with 
configuration taken from ```cmd/otelcollector-castai/builder-config.yaml```.


### Modify Collector's distribution
Install builder:
```
go install go.opentelemetry.io/collector/cmd/builder@latest
```
Update components in configuration file:
```
cmd/otelcollector-castai/builder-config.yaml
```
(Refer to OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib Distro's [manifest](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/blob/main/distributions/otelcol-contrib/manifest.yaml) for full list of available components).

Run the following command to generate the golang source code and get modules:

```
make update-collector
```
### Build binary with existing configuration
```
make build-collector
```

### Run locally with docker
```
make run-local-docker
```

### Local demo sending logs to Loki 
Demo uses local docker image ```otelcollector-castai:latest``` and exposes following Grafana with Loki backend at http://0.0.0.0:3000

```
make build-collector
docker-compose -f examples/demo/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```
